# Python_project_Rock_Paper_Scissors-
The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors.
This Python project implements the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in a console-based format. The game utilizes the random module for generating computer choices and the colorama module to add color to the console output.

The player competes against the computer in a series of rounds, with each round displaying the choices made and the outcome. The game continues until the player decides to end it. At the end of the game, the final scores are displayed, showcasing the number of ties, wins, and losses for both the player and the CPU.

With colorful output and clear prompts, this project provides an engaging and interactive experience for users while demonstrating the use of external modules in Python programming.
